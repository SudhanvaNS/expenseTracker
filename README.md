<h1>Expense Tracker</h1>

The Personal Finance Tracker is a web-based application built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to track their income and expenses, add new transactions, edit transactions, delete transactions, and view the current balance.

<h2> Features</h2>
- Add Transactions: Users can input a description, amount, and type (income or expense) for each transaction. The application validates the input and adds the transaction to the tracker.<br>
- Edit Transactions: Users can edit the description and amount of a transaction by clicking the edit button associated with each transaction. They can make changes and update the transaction.<br>
- Delete Transactions: Users can delete transactions individually by clicking the delete button associated with each transaction in the list.<br>
- Display Transactions: The application dynamically displays a list of all transactions, including the description, amount (with a plus sign for income and a minus sign for expenses), and edit/delete buttons.<br>
- Calculate Balance: The application automatically calculates and displays the current balance by summing the income and subtracting the expenses.<br><br>
